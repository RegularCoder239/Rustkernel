# Rustkernel
## Warning
This kernel is still in early development.
This kernel isn't designed for production and should only be
booted on VMs. It has many major issues, that weren't been fixed yet
and almost no security. I wonÂ´t be responsible for hardware damages,
if this OS is tested on real hardware. This is only a hobby project.
